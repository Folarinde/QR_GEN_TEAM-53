Ask your question in the team's Slack channel.



# Found a bug

1. Check if the [issues tab](https://github.com/zuri-training/QR_GEN_TEAM-53/issues) to see if it has already been reported, or fixed.

2. If the issue has not been created or fixed, [create](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue#creating-an-issue-from-a-repository) a [new issue] (https://github.com/zuri-training/QR_GEN_TEAM-53/issues/new) .

    When creating a new issue, please **provide as much information as possible** so the problem
    can be easily found, and then fixed. The issue should also **contain a descriptive title and a
    brief summary**. If you have a potential solution to the problem already, feel free
    to [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) with your proposed solution to the problem, or you can also explain your solution in the issue description.



# Have a feature request?
